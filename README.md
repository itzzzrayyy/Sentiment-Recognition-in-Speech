# Audio Sentiment Analysis Model

This project implements an **Audio Sentiment Analysis Model** that analyzes audio recordings to detect emotions and sentiment expressed through speech. The model identifies various emotional states such as happiness, anger, sadness, or neutrality by examining audio features like tone, pitch, pace, and volume.

## Features:
- **Emotion Detection:** Identifies emotional tones in speech (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, neutrality).
- **Real-time Analysis:** Processes audio input in real time for immediate sentiment feedback.
- **Supports Various Audio Formats:** Can process multiple audio file formats like WAV, MP3, and others.
- **Speech Feature Extraction:** Analyzes key speech features such as tone, pitch, pace, and volume to determine sentiment.

## Model Details

The model uses deep learning techniques for audio classification, trained on a dataset containing labeled emotional speech. It leverages features like:
- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
- **Pitch and Tone**
- **Speech Rate and Volume**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `librosa`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
